hello-world
===========


Avocados, tacos, salsa and manchego
Beans and tomatoes and a sprig of cilantro
Had on the moon or down on the ground
These are a few of my favourite things

When the sun sets
When the moon rises
When I am feeling bad
I eat a few of my favourite things
Like tacos with prime human salad
And then I feel quite rad

Or thus spake the man on the moon.
